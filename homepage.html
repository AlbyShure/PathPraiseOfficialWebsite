<h1>Welcome to the Path Praise Band Official Website</h1>
<p>Here in the Praise Band, we like to explore all varieties of worship music. All instruments are welcome. Path Co-op meets once a week, during which we will have one hour to practice. Every 3 weeks, we will perform onstage after lunch. Students are welcome to schedule their own performances of worship songs onstage during the weeks that the Praise Band is not scheduled to perform. Every semester, Family Night occurs after the final week of Ten-week classes. The Praise Band will perform multiple songs before and after the scheduled programming. JAM (Jesus And Music) Sessions will be held once a-month all year long. Any questions you have can be sent to allanh03@yahoo.com. Thanks!</p>
